                <h3>My name is Tracy Li Kwai Fleming II, but my artist name is Sting Urameshi. I’ve been an artist for as long as I can remember, but I’m pretty sure I started getting into it when I was six, back when me and my family used to go to church. Since I would rather play video games, I would just draw those scenarios on a notepad. See, I always had an active imagination, and my love for video games and anime like Pokemon, Digimon, and Yugioh just….brought it out. Overtime I would get these “How to Draw” books of Bakugan and Pokemon, and the rest was history. The more stuff I got into, the more I wanted to apply it in my art. By middle school, one person who really pushed my limits in general was my brother (not by blood), and he, along with my sister (by blood) , would attempt to create stories on our own as well. That’s what most likely put me on the path of writing stories myself. That, along with what I’ve done on YouTube, has really pushed my story-telling capabilities. As for my art, my skills really started to improve when I got into high school, and I just kept going from there.

                The reason why I say all of this is to give you a backstory as to why this site exists. As my art continues to grow and evolve, I wanted to make a place to show off some of my favorite pieces over the years. You could call this site some sort of art exhibit of sorts. Here you can see what I’ve made, how I made it, and among other things. I will even put a link to my YouTube channel as well. So thank you for stopping by and taking a look at what I have to show off. I really appreciate it.</h3>
